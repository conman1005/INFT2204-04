When a move is made such that one of the following condition holds, all conflicting cells will be highlighted usign the 'error' CSS class:

- another of the same digit is present elsewhere in the same row
- another of the same digit is present elsewhere in the same column
- another of the same digit is present elsewhere in the same 3x3 block

Note: Be sure to handle the case where the x and y values are identical. That would not be a conflict.

The undo button will undo the last move made by the user. This will include un-highlighting any previously highlighted cells from an erroneous move. In the current setup there are variables which save the entire board state
